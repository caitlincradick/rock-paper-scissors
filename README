## Abstract:
This application is an online game of rock, paper, scissors with the user playing against the computer. It has a 'classic' version with the traditional rock, paper, scissors and 'difficult' version that incldues rock, paper, scissors, lizard and alien. This application allows the user to choose their 'fighter' and the computer will randomly select a 'fighter' and determine the wins based on the rules that are listed on the home page. The wins will update the players' points, and a banner will state the winner or a draw. The user can switch between classic and difficult games, and their scores will persist.

## Context:

## Learning Goals:
Solidify and demonstrate my understanding of:
- DRY JavaScript
- event delegation to handle similar event listeners
- Understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM
- Use problem solving process to break down large problems, solve things step by step, and not rely on an outside “answer” to a logical challenge

## Wins + Challenges:
1. The biggest win was fully understanding ALL of my code and not relying on 'outside' answers, aside from when I was stuck and got guidance from my rock. Looking back on my final project from last inning, it was fully functional but I didn't fully understand it. 

2. Another win was doing the extension to add another file to fully seperate the data model and the DOM. 

The challenges I faced were when I added the extra DOM file and fully seperated the data model and the DOM. It made my code buggy so I had to spend some time debugging it.
